# NewHarvest-modular-bioreactor
The aim of this project was to develop and build a ‘modular bioreactor for muscle tissue engineering’ prototype in collaboration with New Harvest. The provided solution should be well documented open-source, easy and low-cost to rebuild, without compromising on functionality. The finished prototype should contain:
 - a stand-alone incubation system with: 
	* temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration control, 
	* housing, power supply and 
	* open ports for sensory and regulatory I/O of additional modules,
 -	tray modules holding:
	* a controllable perfusion system, 
	* gas exchange and air bubble removal, as well as 
	* customizable tissue platforms for biological samples

## System functionality <a id="sys-fun"></a>
The bioreactor operates on two levels. The incubator is an enclosed unit which allows regulation of internal environmental conditions, currently temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>. The regulatory circuit runs on an ESP32 microcontroller, which allows operation via display and buttons, as well as a web interface and android/iphone app. Parameters can be changed, monitored and logged. Each tray has an additional microcontroller, for regulation of flow rate and open ports for additional sensorics and regulation.
